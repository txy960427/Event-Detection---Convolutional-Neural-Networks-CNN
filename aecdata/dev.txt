scott 2004-11-16t13 :47:00 from reuters : u.s. marines rallied round a comrade under investigation for killing a wounded iraqi during the offensive in falluja , saying he was probably under combat stress in unpredictable , hair-trigger circumstances .

marines interviewed on tuesday said they did n't see the shooting as a scandal , rather the act of a comrade who faced intense pressure during the effort to quell the insurgency in the city .

of course the anti-american world press is jumping all over this story , casually omitting the fact that just a day earlier the marine in question lost a fellow soldier who was attending to a dead insurgent that was booby-trapped with explosives .

add the tactic of booby-trapping your own dead to the effective suicide bombings , and it 's clear to say that the geneva convention is n't on the minds of the insurgents .

but i also should report that there is a sense of annoyance here at the white house , even among some of mr. chalabi 's top supporters , that , since returning to iraq in recent days , he has complained frequently , including on our air earlier today , that the united states is moving too slowly to get in the reconstruction efforts , to restore electricity and restore water .

in a monstrous conflict of interest for a supposed straight news reporter , fasulo acknowledges ted turner 's u.n. foundation and better world campaign for `` their generous financial support '' of her book project .

another endorsement of the book comes from barbara crossette , former new york times bureau chief at the u.n. who now writes for u.n. wire , a ted turner-funded online news service that covers the u.n.

the truth is that , as director of u.n. peacekeeping , annan personally refused requests to authorize u.n. peacekeepers in rwanda to seize weapons and prevent genocide .

writer and author philip gourevitch has described in detail how , three months before the genocide , major general romeo dallaire , the commander of several thousand u.n. troops in rwanda , sent a fax to kofi annan 's office , saying he had received evidence from a rwandan government informant that genocide was being planned .

the article ends with the following : in an april 30 , 2001 , washington times column , nat hentoff noted that the media have devoted `` scant mention '' to the `` plain fact that it was mr. annan , when he was head of the united nation 's peacekeeping office , who could have prevented the slaughter of 800,000 tutsis and their sympathizers in rwanda in 1994 .

it 's true , hentoff said , that the u.n. issued a report in 1999 that acknowledged , to some extent , its role in the killings .

but for five and a half years , he noted , annan `` refused to accept any responsibility for the rwandan holocaust until mr. gourevitch and others revealed that less than 5,000 u.n. troops could have stopped the killings if mr. annan had not closed his eyes . ''

in the past two weeks , the officials said , france has rebuffed appeals by secretary of state condoleezza rice and the israeli foreign minister , silvan shalom , to list hezbollah as a terrorist organization , which would prevent it from raising money in europe through charity groups .

the united states has long called hezbollah a terrorist organization , but the french , american and european officials said , have opposed doing so , and argue that making such a designation now would be unwise , given the new turbulence in lebanon .

but as the captain points out , it probably has more to do with iran : i suspect the true reason for the reluctance comes not from the `` delicate '' nature of lebanese politics , but from the relationship between hezbollah and the iranians .

perhaps the accountant was following a procedure followed by the uscf for scholastic tournaments .

at scholastic tournaments , no cash prizes are paid .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
however , in adult tournaments , the players expect to receive their prizes , and to receive them immediately .

0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
for this act of stupidity which had caused a grave crisis in the uscf , the accountant was immediately fired .

had the existence of this $ 85,000 in a secret bank account been known , it would not have been necessary to fire those 17 people right away .

perhaps in the long run it was a good thing to fire them , but it might not have been a good idea to fire them all abruptly , in the same day .

i also knew about the $ 100,000 + of audit adjustments and non-adjustments for inventory , unbilled advertising , newsstand sales , tournament revenues , pension & health insurance over-accruals , multi year membership revenue , etc. etc. that i was too sick to argue with linda and the auditors about .

petrel sat , 18 dec 2004 02:11:28 gmt ethical and legal issues in hiring marinello it has been suggested that there is , or was at one time , some sort of delegates ' motion which established a minimum period between the time someone could leave the eb and the time someone could be hired by the uscf .

i do n't know if this is so , and i really think it 's sort of irrelevant .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
it 's irrelevant because the real question is whether an active board member can , while on the board , arrange to be given money by the uscf .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0
of course it 's in the bylaws that an active board member can not be given money by the uscf while on the board .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 5 0
it ought to be pretty obvious that it would be entirely contrary to the spirit of this for an active board member to be money after leaving the board .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 18 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0
suppose , for example , there were to be a proposal to the effect that each eb member would be given $ 10,000 upon the expiration of his/her term .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 18 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 10 10 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
clearly this would be a transparent attempt to evade the bylaws and would fail .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
if the board can not vote to give themselves present money , they can not vote to give themselves future money either .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 8 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 8 0 0 0
furthermore , it does n't matter whether this arrangement is embodied in an eb vote or not , or whether the discussion of the proposal takes place in a formal eb meeting or not .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 15 0 0 0

a board member , while on the board , is supposed to be representing the interests of the uscf , not feathering his/her nest , in the present or in the future .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 8 8 0
if a board member makes such arrangements , it is clearly an ethics violation , clearly a violation of the bylaws , possibly endangers our tax-exempt status , and is possibly a violation of law as well .
0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

the purpose of having a `` time limit '' would be as a mechanism to ensure compliance with the above principles ; that is , you would have a time limit because it would reduce the likelihood that someone would be tempted to violate the above prohibition ; it would give the voters time to elect a new eb that would consider the issues objectively .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 20 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

of course , it is possible that someone could leave the board - without - ever having discussed being compensated by the board in the future , and that then the remaining members could , for good reason , hire that person .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 18 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 17 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0
it would create questions among the suspicious - and avoiding this appearance of wrongdoing would be another good reason for a time limit - but it would n't automatically be an ethics or bylaws violation .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

but this is neither here nor there , because the fact that randy bauer is already talking about beatriz marinello as the uscf 's new `` move coordinator '' , whatever that involves , and whether or not it means that she would be the de facto interim ed , means that at some level and in some form these discussions have already taken place , while marinello is serving as president .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 17 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

i mean , it 's conceivable that the other six have all gotten together in marinello 's absence and drafted her , but it also seems pretty clear that she has agreed to do it , and , if all the rumors are true and she steps_down , it will be so that she can take on these new responsibilities .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 17 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 18 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

so the ` time limit ' issue does n't even come up .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
we pretty much know that marinello , while on the board , has arranged to get future money from the uscf .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0
5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 4 0
so we already have a problem .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 5 0 0 0 0 0
if this is not a problem , i wish someone would explain to me why not .

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0
now , stan b. argues that marinello 's services are in fact indispensible as move coordinator , and that ethics standards are not a suicide pact , so that since we absolutely need her the eb has the right to go ahead and retain her .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 5 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0
i agree with the principle .
0 0 0 0 0 0
5 0 0 0 0 0
but i think that to make this argument work the eb would have to produce some evidence that marinello really is indispensible for this task .
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
this would have to include evidence that the eb had considered all the alternatives , including : - delegating the whole thing to the interim ed , which would be the normal practice in normal organizations with an ed - asking the interim ed to designate someone from the new windsor staff to act as move coordinator - asking the interim ed to hire some other consultant with experience in office relocation to manage the job there are such people - conducting some kind of actual search for candidates for the position during the last two months since the move was decided upon if they did consider alternatives , it would also have to include evidence that marinello has much more experience at relocating offices than other people , or is willing to do the job cheaper although this would n't constitute being `` indispensible '' in my view .

one very bad argument that was made by kevin bachler , which to be fair was surrounded by arguably better ones , was that since this board was elected , we should let them do as they please .

another argument , which is better but still disturbing , is that , yes , this is an ethics violation , and maybe worse , but it would only hurt the uscf to talk about it , and that only troublemakers like sam sloan , larry parr , and , i suppose , me , would talk about it , since doing so will obstruct the federation 's plans , cause us to pay legal expenses , run the risk of our being stuck without any office space at all , cause people not to loan us money , and so forth .

but if we are going to talk about realism , here is another realistic concern : i predict that , if , in fact , the rumors about the agenda for the florida meeting prove true , and marinello resigns as president and is hired as move coordinator , the immediate result of this is that sam sloan will file another lawsuit or amend his current complaint charging the uscf eb members with self-dealing , violation of the uscf 's own bylaws , and every other thing , report us to the irs , and demand that all uscf moneys which might be used to paid marinello be frozen .

if he is willing to file a lawsuit on the basis of new york non-profit organization law , which might or might not be applicable to the uscf , why would n't he file a lawsuit on the basis of the uscf 's violation of its own bylaws , which unquestionably are applicable to the uscf ?
